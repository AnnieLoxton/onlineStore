# Online Store with Cart

## About this project
For this project, students were tasked with creating an online store using HTML and CSS, and then adding a functional cart using Javascript.

This version of my online store features a basic cart, where the user can add the products to the cart straight from the 'Shop' page, remove products, and checkout.
Additional features such as shipping options and discount codes proved problematic and hindered the functionality of the cart, so I have left them off for now. Hopefully as my knowledge and skills grow I will be able to add these features back in and have a fully functional cart. Watch this space!

## Installation
1. Download the project folder to your local drive.
2. Open the *landing.html* file in your web browser.
3. That's it! You will now be able to interact with this project.

## Usage
- When you open *landing.html* you will land on the homepage of the website.

- When a product is added to the cart, and alert notifies the user of their total.

- Once you're in the cart, you can see what products have been added and what the total is.

## Credits
This project would not have been possible without the JavaScript Shopping Cart Tutorials by Telmo Sampaio. The videos were very easy to follow, and he explained everything in a way that made sense. You actually learn something instead of just following along.
